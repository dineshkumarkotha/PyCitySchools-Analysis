# PyCitySchools Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the district-wide standardized test results for a city's school district. The analysis includes aggregating the data to showcase trends in school performance, including:

- **Top-performing schools** based on overall passing rates.
- **Bottom-performing schools** based on overall passing rates.
- **Math and reading scores** by grade.
- **Scores by school spending, size, and type.**

The analysis is performed using Python and Pandas, and the results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the performance of schools in the district. **Key findings** include:

### **Top Performing Schools**
‚úÖ Charter schools generally outperform district schools in both math and reading scores.

### **Bottom Performing Schools**
‚ùå District schools tend to have lower overall passing rates compared to charter schools.

### **Math and Reading Scores by Grade**
üìä Scores are relatively consistent across different grades within each school.

### **Scores by School Spending**
üí∞ Schools with **lower per-student budgets** tend to have **higher overall passing rates**.

### **Scores by School Size**
üè´ **Smaller schools** tend to have **higher overall passing rates** compared to larger schools.

### **Scores by School Type**
üìà **Charter schools** have **higher overall passing rates** compared to district schools.
