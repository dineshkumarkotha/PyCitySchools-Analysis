# PyCitySchools Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the district-wide standardized test results for a city's school district. The analysis includes aggregating the data to showcase trends in school performance, including:

- Top-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
- Bottom-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
- Math and reading scores by grade.
- Scores by school spending, size, and type.

The analysis is performed using Python and Pandas, and the results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the performance of schools in the district. Key findings include:

Top Performing Schools: Charter schools generally outperform district schools in both math and reading scores.

Bottom Performing Schools: District schools tend to have lower overall passing rates compared to charter schools.

Math and Reading Scores by Grade: Scores are relatively consistent across different grades within each school.

Scores by School Spending: Schools with lower per-student budgets tend to have higher overall passing rates.

Scores by School Size: Smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools.

Scores by School Type: Charter schools have higher overall passing rates compared to district schools.
